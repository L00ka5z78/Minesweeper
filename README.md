# Minesweeper
Simple minsweeper game written in JS, css, html

To be honest it is simple game, but it was very challenging to make it work.
First of all I used many hours to watch some tutorials to understand the logic behind the game.
And when i was ready, tried to write on my own. I made it, but it was not easy.

Things im happy with:
  1. Styling, looks like windows old school game.
  2. Loops, and conditions. Works well.
  3. I think code is clear, and easy to undestand and follow.
  
Things i should be better at:
  1. To many functions in one file.
  2. Big code blocks, abd big conditions. Is it possible to write it, in smaller code bits?
  3. It would be nice to have a 'restart' button after game over, not just resfresh the browser. Possible i will add it later, but theres so many others things to code..
